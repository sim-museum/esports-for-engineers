# esports-for-engineers
Let's work together to maintain some of the best old engineering simulation games.  

This project provides a linux installer containing a free, award-winning sim or strategy game for each day of the week. The games are organized into a weeklong mindsports decathlon, with a mechanism for scoring each day and saving the user's game files.  Some slides describing the game package are [here](https://github.com/sim-museum/esports-for-engineers/blob/master/esports-for-engineers-brochure.pdf).  There is also a self-study class [syllabus](https://github.com/sim-museum/esports-for-engineers/blob/master/files/syllabusFor_eSportsForEngineers.pdf) for learning the games.

To play the games:

1. Choose either the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS package or the newer Ubuntu 24.04 LTS package.  The 22.04 package is 
quicker to download and install.  The 24.04 package provides incremental improvements to stability, 
documentation and games, and is supported long-term.
 
2. Install the operating system for the package you chose, either Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. A partition
size of at least 400 GB is recommended.

3. Download and unpack the chosen game package, either the [22.04 game package](https://www.mediafire.com/file/1cz9zq1z54x7765/esports-for-engineers22041LTS.tar.gz/file) or the [24.04 game package](https://mega.nz/file/fE8R0YRT#TKcgjf4Id4txC0qA3mv0Pqam812DTl2klqEvB1v7Iuc)

4. Optional: check the sha256sum for the downloaded package, either "4bdb371e9dec4426a7e3663262a09875e37c043e24e2026a4e01d5877a520030 esports-for-engineers22041LTS.tar.gz" or "c3f4df7557f0324075d249d5f26aa8ffcf97d000ca958ec890d22a06cb436c90 esports-for-engineers-2404LTS.tar.gz"

5. Unpack tar.gz file downloaded in step 3, then follow the instructions in ese/runThisScriptFirst.sh to install needed ubuntu packages

6. Run the launcher script, then select a game from the menu to play it:

Note: The game tar file is a clone of this repo with binaries, documentation pdfs, etc. added to the directory tree.  A separate binaries-included clone file is needed because github does not host large binaries.  Generating binaries from source is difficult, as this is old MS Windows source code which requires a legacy development environment for compilation.

Since this project runs Microsoft Windows programs on Linux, both Windows and Linux development expertise is needed.
