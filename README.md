# esports-for-engineers
Let's work together to maintain some of the best old engineering simulation games.  

This project provides a linux installer containing a free, award-winning sim or strategy game for each day of the week. The games are organized into a weeklong mindsports decathlon, with a mechanism for scoring each day and saving the user's game files.  Some slides describing the game package are [here](https://github.com/sim-museum/esports-for-engineers/blob/master/esports-for-engineers-brochure.pdf).  There is also a self-study class [syllabus](https://github.com/sim-museum/esports-for-engineers/blob/master/files/syllabusFor_eSportsForEngineers.pdf) for learning the games.

To play the games:
1. install Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
2. download and unpack the [game package](https://www.mediafire.com/file/1cz9zq1z54x7765/esports-for-engineers22041LTS.tar.gz/file).
3. Optional: check file integrity by running sha256sum on the download and comparing the output to "4bdb371e9dec4426a7e3663262a09875e37c043e24e2026a4e01d5877a520030  esports-for-engineers22041LTS.tar.gz"
3. extract the ese directory from tar.gz file downloaded in step 2, then follow the instructions in ese/runThisScriptFirst.sh to install needed ubuntu packages
4. run the launcher script, then select a game from the menu to play it:

Note: The game tar file is a clone of this repo with binaries, documentation pdfs, etc. added to the directory tree.  A separate binaries-included clone file is needed because github does not host large binaries.  Generating binaries from source is difficult, as this is old MS Windows source code which requires a legacy development environment for compilation.

Since this project runs Microsoft Windows programs on Linux, both Windows and Linux development expertise is needed.
