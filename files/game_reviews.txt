Battle of Britain is a high-quality flight simulation game that offers immersion, attention to detail, visual appeal, and intense flight combat. Developed by Rowan Software, the game is split into two parts: a strategic layer where players manage the air effort of the Royal Air Force or the Luftwaffe, and an in-the-cockpit depiction of aerial combat. The game features five flyable aircraft and offers a realistic flight experience that challenges players. However, Battle of Britain may require significant time investment to work properly and is not accessible to novice pilots. The game's technical issues, such as crashing and stuttering, may also deter some players. Despite these problems, Battle of Britain is praised for its detailed treatment of the epic air campaign and its impressive dogfighting experience. Hard-core flight-sim enthusiasts will likely appreciate the game, while casual gamers and novices may struggle with its complexity.

Despite the lack of a full campaign, Fighter Squadron: Screamin' Demons Over Europe stands out in the crowded field of World War II sims with its focus on intense dogfighting experiences. Created by Parsoft, the sim features detailed physics and flight models, with excellent damage models but somewhat neutered flight models compared to beta versions. Fighter Squadron offers ten flyable planes, including bombers, and has 30 single-player missions set in three theaters. The pilot AI is above average, making missions challenging, and multiplayer mode is smooth and reliable. While not the most realistic sim, Fighter Squadron excels in dogfighting experiences, especially against human players. If improvements are made to enable stalls and spins, it could become the top choice for pilots seeking free online play.

Dogfighting in MiG Alley is considered one of the best experiences for virtual pilots, offering a range of flyable models of different planes from the Korean War era. The game stands out for its accurate and diverse flight models, challenging gameplay, and immersive atmosphere with realistic graphics and sound effects. MiG Alley also features dynamic campaigns that add to the longevity and appeal of the game, making it a technically excellent simulation with a gameplay experience that surpasses its technical accomplishments. Despite some missing features, MiG Alley is highly regarded among flight sim fans and is expected to be remembered fondly for years to come.
