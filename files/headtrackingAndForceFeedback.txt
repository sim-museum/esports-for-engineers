Hardware devices for force feedback (FF) and head tracking make the sims more challenging,
realistic and immersive.  Getting these devices working on linux can be difficult, but
there are exceptions.  The Microsoft Sidewinder FF joystick and Logitech FF wheels work
out of the box; no configuration is needed.

The Microsoft Sidewinder force feedback joystick works with several sims in this package; no
configuration is needed.  It works well with THU/Training/FS9.  It provides
force feedback for other sims as well, including THU/Training/SDOE, THU/MigAlley, 
THU/BattleOfBritain, TUE/rFactor and TUE/NR2003.

FF wheels from vendors other than Logitech may be supported in Ubuntu 22.04LTS, or
they may not.  A driver for the Thrustmaster TX wheel is in TUE/INSTALL/tmdrv-master.  
(This driver does not provide FF).  For more information about linux FF wheel support,
see, e.g.,

The opentrack software provides headtracking for linux, when used with a webcam
and LED lights that attach to a headset.  A popular webcam/LED device is
delanclip:

To configure delanclip to work with THU/Training/flightgear, type in a terminal: 

#install needed packages
time sudo apt install -y git cmake git qttools5-dev qtbase5-private-dev libprocps-dev libopencv-dev g++ subversion wine-development vim okular flightgear libeigen3-dev gcc-multilib g++-multilib wine32-development wine32-development-preloader wine32-development-tools cmake-curses-gui plocate

#build opentrack from source
mkdir delanclip
# opentrack URL: https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack/releases/tag/opentrack-2022.1.1
cp TUE/INSTALL/opentrack-opentrack-2022.1.1.zip delanclip
unzip opentrack-opentrack-2022.1.1.zip
cd delanclip/opentrack-opentrack-2022.1.1
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

# run the text menu configuration program ccmake
# set the eigen3 path to /usr/include/eigen3
# set windows sdk to ON
# choose continue
# choose generate
ccmake .

# now compile and build
make
make install

cd install/bin

./opentrack

# in the opentrack gui, click the tool icon in the input section, then choose
# Camera/Camera Settngs/Device to be your PS3 webcam, not an internal webcam
# if using headtracking with flightgear, choose "Flightgear" under Output
# if using another sim which runs under wine,  chose "Wine" under Output
# then select the tool icon to the right and enter the path to the sims'
# wine prefix
# select "Start" and verify that the webcam is tracking the LED's
# and that raw tracker data and game data numbers change as the
# LED fixture is moved around.

# copy the delanclip profile to the opentrack config directory
cp ~/esports-for-engineers/TUE/INSTALL/delanclip/DELANCLiP-Opentrack-Basic.ini ~/.config/opentrack-2.3

#if you use 
# sudo ./opentrack
# to avoid setting permissions
# the config directory will be /root/.config/opentrack-2.3

# if running delanclip with a sim that uses wine, call wine as follows
# WINEESYNC=1 wine <sim>

#if running delanclip with the flightgear sim, type these commands:

#download the flightgear Headtracker add-on
sudo apt install -y subversion
svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/flightgear/fgaddon/trunk/Addons/Headtracker
#or copy this directory from TUE/INSTALL/delanclip

# run flightgear
fgfs --addon=/home/main/Headtracker --generic=socket,in,25,127.0.0.1,5542,udp,opentrack
