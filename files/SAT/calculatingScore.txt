SAT Scoring
eSports for Engineers 24041LTS 

As with the other games, be sure to record your flights and copy the
resulting .vhs files to the SAT/afterGamereport directory.  If using
free falcon, press the "F" key to toggle the recording on and off.  Use the
./getBriefingDebriefing.sh command to copy Briefing.txt and
debrief.txt into the SAT directory.  Copy these files also into
SAT/afterGameReport, along with any relevant screenshots from Tacview
and notes.  If using one of the more advanced Benchmark Sims (BMS)
versions of Falcon 4 (see below), you can also put screenshots from
Weapon Delivery Planner (WDP) in the SAT/afterGamereport directory.

With more than 25 years of development so far, the Falcon 4.0 series is one 
of the longest running game series using the same code base in PC history.
Several versions can be used with esports for engineers.  In order of
release date, these are:

1. 2005: Falcon 4 Allied Force (simplest in scope, well documented, free dowload.)

2. 2010: Free Falcon (free and open source, included with esports for engineers.)

3. other, more recent versions are also available on the internet

Install scripts for the first 2 versions are included with this package.
Each version has its own strengths and drawbacks, and some may not install on 
your computer.

You can complete the SAT tasks with Falcon Allied Force (the simplest),
with Free Falcon (which is included in this package) or with one of the 
more recent versions.

manual at 

SAT/DOC/Falcon 4 Allied Force/F4AFManual.pdf

(The more recent versions of Falcon 4 are similar but more complicated; 
each later version comes with much longer manuals so the Falcon 4 Allied
Force manual is a great place to start.)

---------------------------------------------------------------

for getting two AIM-120 missiles in the air at the same time, with different
targets, in TWS mode, where both missiles hit their targets.  (Refer
to the Falcon AF manual or SAT/DOC/Falcon BMS Acronym Companion.pdf
to look up acronyms).

for hitting a target with a AIM-120 using TWS, where you don't
turn on STT until just before pitbull to give the target minimum
time to react to the RWR warning.  Put two vhs record files in the
afterGameReport, one showing a normal missile launch and
the other this minimum warning launch.

OKR #2, 2

add .2 to your score for flying 5 different airplanes in successful campaign
missions.  (Falcon Allied Force has only one flyable aircraft,
the F16, so it cannot be used here.)

---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #3, 1

The realistic campaigns are:

In Falcon Allied Force: Balkans theater

In Free Falcon: the three Israeli theater campaigns (Six Day War –
1967, Yom Kippur – 1973, Shlom Hagalil – 1982) and Balkans.  Note
that in the case of the 1967 and 1982 warns you need to load
one of the saved campaign rather than starting a new one due
to a bug which causes a new campaign to crash.

In addition to Israel and Balkans, the more advanced BMS versions 
of Falcon 4 provide these additional realistic campaigns: 
Kuwait, Vietnam and Somalia.  See SAT/AdvancedFalcon4.pdf for details.

Score is based on your mission rating as shown in the logbook.

score = rating on mission flown/5, averaged over the last 5 missions
flown, with score capped at 0.7
