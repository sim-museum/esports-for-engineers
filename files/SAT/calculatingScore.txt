SAT Scoring
eSports for Engineers 22041LTS 

As with the other games, be sure to record your flights and copy the
resulting .vhs files to the SAT/afterGamereport directory.  If using
free falcon, press the "F" key to toggle the recording on and off.  Use the
./getBriefingDebriefing.sh command to copy Briefing.txt and
debrief.txt into the SAT directory.  Copy these files also into
SAT/afterGameReport, along with any relevant screenshots from Tacview
and notes.  If using one of the more advanced Benchmark Sims (BMS)
versions of Falcon 4 (see below), you can also put screenshots from
Weapon Delivery Planner (WDP) in the SAT/afterGamereport directory.

With more than 25 years of development so far, the Falcon 4.0 series is one 
of the longest running game series using the same code base in PC history.
Several versions can be used with esports for engineers.  In order of
release date, these are:

1. 2005: Falcon 4 Allied Force (simplest in scope, well documented, free dowload.)

2. 2010: Free Falcon (free and open source, included with esports for engineers.)

3. other, more recent versions are also available on the internet

Install scripts for the first 2 versions are included with this package.
Each version has its own strengths and drawbacks, and some may not install on 
your computer.

You can complete the SAT tasks with Falcon Allied Force (the simplest),
with Free Falcon (which is included in this package) or with one of the 
more recent versions.

OBJECTIVE #1: UNDERSTAND COURSE MATERIAL FROM REAL-LIFE PILOT TRAINING
OBJECTIVE #2: LEARN COMBAT FLIGHT SIM FREE FLIGHT, BOMBING AND DOGFIGHT
OBJECTIVE #3: (ASPIRATIONAL) WIN DYNAMIC CAMPAIGNS
OBJECTIVE #4: USER DEFINED (can be regular or aspirational)

---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #1, 1

add .2 points to your score for skimming all 500 pages of the Falcon AF
manual at 

SAT/DOC/Falcon 4 Allied Force/F4AFManual.pdf

(The more recent versions of Falcon 4 are similar but more complicated; 
each later version comes with much longer manuals so the Falcon 4 Allied
Force manual is a great place to start.)

---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #1, 2

Add .025 point to your daily score for each of the following tasks that
you complete; the upper limit is 0.7 as usual.

learning how to take off, land and use the weapons
systems in the flightgear f16.  To fly this aircraft run the script
./training_F16.sh

learning to take off, land and use the cockpit instruments
of the MiG21.  To fly this aircraft, run the script:
./training_MiG21.sh

trying out and understanding all the FF6 keyboard
commands in Falcon4KeyboardCommands.pdf

skimming all documentation

taking off, flying a traffic pattern and landing the F16 in
Falcon 4 using only the trim controls, not the main elevator
and aileron controls.

watching BMS 4.32 – Install to Combat Ready in 1 Hour on
Youtube at URL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU3pmXvnc0k To save
time and protect hearing turn off sound and use close caption text at
2x speed.  (Note that BMS 4.32 is a more advanced version of the FF6
software – see below).

for becoming more familiar with FF6 keyboard commands by doing
ramp start entirely using the Function key commands listed in
INSTALL/US Page 1 FF5.pdf

for getting two AIM-120 missiles in the air at the same time, with different
targets, in TWS mode, where both missiles hit their targets.  (Refer
to the Falcon AF manual or SAT/DOC/Falcon BMS Acronym Companion.pdf
to look up acronyms).

for hitting a target with a AIM-120 using TWS, where you don't
turn on STT until just before pitbull to give the target minimum
time to react to the RWR warning.  Put two vhs record files in the
afterGameReport, one showing a normal missile launch and
the other this minimum warning launch.  


---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #2, 1

Add .05 point to your daily score for each of the following tasks that
you complete; the upper limit is 0.7 as usual.

a. ILS instrument landing

b. guns-only dogfight win

c. IR missile dogfight win

d. radar missile dogfight win

e. CCIP bombing, for this and other air-to-ground weapons, you get
no points unless at least some of the intended targets were destroyed.

were destroyed in the afterGameReport directory.

f. CCRP bombing

g. maverick

h. HARM

i. laser guided bombing

j.use IFF, available in Free Falcon and BMS 4.35 (see pdf in SAT/DOC for instructions)

least 7 of the 9 tasks above take off, fly a traffic pattern and land
using only trim controls, (that is to say without using joystick
inputs or otherwise moving the elevator, aileron or rudder)

l. successful missile evasion tactial engagement

---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #2, 2

add .2 to your score for flying 5 different airplanes in successful campaign
missions.  (Falcon Allied Force has only one flyable aircraft,
the F16, so it cannot be used here.)

---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #3, 1

The realistic campaigns are:

In Falcon Allied Force: Balkans theater

In Free Falcon: the three Israeli theater campaigns (Six Day War –
1967, Yom Kippur – 1973, Shlom Hagalil – 1982) and Balkans.  Note
that in the case of the 1967 and 1982 warns you need to load
one of the saved campaign rather than starting a new one due
to a bug which causes a new campaign to crash.

In addition to Israel and Balkans, the more advanced BMS versions 
of Falcon 4 provide these additional realistic campaigns: 
Kuwait, Vietnam and Somalia.  See SAT/AdvancedFalcon4.pdf for details.

Score is based on your mission rating as shown in the logbook.

score = rating on mission flown/5, averaged over the last 5 missions
flown, with score capped at 0.7

---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #3, 1

score =1 for winning any of the campaigns listed above (playing either side),

---------------------------------------------------------------

Non-free Alternatives

More advanced and complex versions of the Falcon 4 code are available, and
can be run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.  

It's up to you which of the version to use for the OKRs, free falcon,
which is included, Falcon Allied Force, for which an install script
is provided, or one of the more recent versions.  Each version
has unique strengths and weaknesses in the form of documentation, ease of
installation or use, and suitability to a particular OKR.
