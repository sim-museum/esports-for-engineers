2. make sure you are using the advanced version of wine: run ./wine_experimental.sh

winetricks dxvk

4. if using the optional, but recommmended, Weapon Delivery Planner utility (see below), 
then install .NET 40 also via
winetricks dotnet40

5. if using the optional, but recommended, Tacview utility, download it from this
link:
https://www.tacview.net/download/license/en/?file=Tacview184Setup.exe&mirror=0

or edit the script to use a later version if you prefer.
Place it in the BMS435/INSTALL directory

6. Place the bms files in the ese/tar directory, which then copies these files to the BMS4.35/INSTALL directory

To check that everything is correctly added to the BMS4.35/INSTALL directory,
cd INSTALL
ls -Rlt > INSTALL_myListing.txt
diff INSTALL_myListing.txt INSTALL_completeDirectoryListing.txt

7. buy the original Falcon 4 game

More information about the weapon delivery planner utility:

The Weapon Delivery Planner (WDP) is a convenient, but optional, utility for
preparing for missions.  To install it, download from

http://www.weapondeliveryplanner.nl/

unpack the Weapon Delivery Planner and copy it to BMS435
In the BMS435 directory (the script files provide more detailed instructions).

Since the Weapon Delivery Planner version number changes over time, it
cannot be predicted what the exact version number you download will be.
The script is set up to install from a directory with the name "WeaponDeliveryPlanner_BMS435"
so rename the directory such that it has this name.
then execute the script
./runWeaponDeliveryPlanner.sh

Note that you will need to run this script each time you use the
Weapon Delivery Planner.

If a .NET warning dialog box appears, select "Continue"

If a "falcon bms.exe" is not responding warning dialog appears,
select "Wait" or simply do nothing; the dialog box will disappear in a few seconds.

Set your BMS 4.35 rudder and throttle axes for your joystick in Setup/Controller/Advanced options.
