For sharper graphics, speed and configurability you might
want to install the linux native versions of scid
and nibbler
To install in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS:

sudo apt install -y libopenblas-dev scid stockfish phalanx

now run ./nibbler.sh

this is now running the linux binary, which has better graphics quality
you must specify the linux engine binary for nibbler.  Select Engine/Choose engine
and navigate to WED/INSTALL/lc0_cpu

Optional: For graphics acceleration of the Leela Chess Zero engine in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, install needed machine learning graphics library via
sudo apt install -y nvidia-opencl-dev
Then, in nibbler, select Engine/Choose engine
and navigate to WED/INSTALL/lc0_linux_graphicsAcceleration/lc0_opencl

Note:  Generally the larger the weight file, the stronger the play.  To make lc0 a better chess player, choose a larger weight file in Nibbler.  There are several weight files to choose from in the directory (path)/WED/INSTALL/otherWeights

Now run ./scid.sh
In tools/Analysis engine #1 type "lc0_cpu", click on "..." and
navigate to (path)/WED/INSTALL/lc0_cpu
Also install the stockfish engine.  In tools/Analysis engine #2
type "stockfish" for engine name and command.
Also load the database of master chess games
Choose File/Open and navigate to WED/INSTALL/25000grandMasterGames.si4


the linux version of Nibbler saves its configuration information in:
$HOME/.config/Nibbler
The path to leela chess zero is in this file:
$HOME/.config/Nibbler/config.json

the linux version of SCID saves its configuration in the directory
$HOME/.scid4.7

Optional: BanksiaGui is an alternative to nibbler which graphically displays move values on the board like Sabaki and q5go (see FRI).  To configure and run BanksiaGui, type
./BanksiaGui.sh
The follow these steps to configure (also see the BanksiaGui screenshots in installTips.pdf):
1. From the menu select File/Settings/Engines
2. Click "+" to add a new engine and navigate to the engine file, e.g. lc0_cpu
3. Click "OK" and then click on the engine name to see engine options
4. Scroll down to the last option in the list, "WeightsFile".  
5. The value for WeightsFile is set to "<autodiscover>", which may automatically find a weights file in the same directory as the engine you specified.  In case that doesn't work, double click on "<autodiscover>" and replace it with the full path and file name for your weights file.  Alternatively, edit the WeightsFile field directly in $HOME/.config/BanksiaGUI/banksiaengines.json
6. To display engine stats during games, select the engine options "LogLiveStats", "UCI_ShowWDL" and "VerboseMoveStats"

To reset configuration, delete the configuration directories via:
rm -rf $HOME/.config/Nibbler
rm -rf $HOME/.scid4.7
rm -rf $HOME/.config/BanksiaGui
