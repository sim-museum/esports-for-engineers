By default, a Windows version of bcalc will be run under wine.  This allows for
maximum compatibility with different linux distributions.  For better speed and
graphics, enable the linux binary version of bcalc.  If you install the 
libraries with the command below on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, ./bcalc.sh will 
automatically switch to the linux version.

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS versions of libraries needed for linux native bcalcgui:

sudo apt install -y liblua5.2-dev libqt5widgets5 

now run ./bcalc.sh
The graphics are now sharper because you're running a native linux 
binary.
