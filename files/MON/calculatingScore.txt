MON Scoring

OBJECTIVE #1: LEARN FROM AI FEEDBACK
OBJECTIVE #2: DEEPEN YOUR KNOWLEDGE WITH BRIDGE VARIANTS, ANALYSIS
OBJECTIVE #3: USER DEFINED (can be regular or aspirational)

---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #1,1, first key result for objective "learn from AI feedback"

Run ./wBridge4.sh Set level to 5.

Play 4 hands of duplicate bridge.  (Don't select "Dup" to start play
in the closed room until the Dummmy hand has been laid out ; this will
cause the 4 AI players to start play using the same bid).

Play these 4 hands in a single wBridge5 session; your total
International Match Points (IMP) score for the 4 hands will be
displayed at lower left.

score=(IMP+18)/20*.25, if score>.4 then set score=.4, if score<0 then
set score=0 If you viewed all the hidden cards during play, multiply
score by 0.8

There is no penalty for displaying info (on lower right in
./wBridge5sh).

Rather than using "Dup", you can play the hand yourself, save to .pbn
and txt, reload, then have the computer play the hand, then save to pbn
and txt.  This way you have saved two files documenting your game,
and two files documenting the computer-only game with the same hand.
You can use an IMP table to convert the difference between your
score and the computer-only score to IMP.

---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #1,2

Skim all documentation in the MON directory.  Read an introductory
Bridge book such as Bayone, “A Taste of Bridge”, Master Point Press
(2017).

score=0.1
---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #1,3

Play 8 hands of duplicate bridge, this time allowing for a different
bid in the closed room by selecting “Dup” before the bidding phase.
Now you are being scored on the bidding as well as the card play.
For the last 4 hands, specify in Options/Deal that a random player
will have >19 points.  Viewing hidden cards is not permitted at the
silver level.  Adjusting your partner’s bidding
in Options/Bidding is allowed.  Setting the bidding convention
to Standard American Yellow Card (SAYC) is recommended for beginners.
  Determine score from net IMP as in OKR #1,1
except with “.25” replaced by ".5" wherever it appears
in the score formula, i.e. score=(IMP+18)/20*.5, if score>.5 then
set score=.5, if score<0 then set score=0
---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #1,4

Study bridge bidding, (see the videos and book recommentations in
the DOC directory).

score: 0.1
---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #2,1

Same as OKR #1,3, except specify in Options/Deal that a random player
will have >19 points.  Scoring is the same as in OKR #1,3
---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #2,2

Same as OKR #1,3, except select "Goulash" in Options/Deal. In goulash
bridge, the deck is cut between hands but not thoroughly shuffled, 
making long suits more common and thus changing optimum strategy. 
Scoring is the same as in OKR #1,3
---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #2,3

Review all play made in a previous OKR with .bcalc.sh.  Create a text 
file in the afterGameReport directory describing insights 
gained.  (You could also try using ./tenace.sh, but you'd have
to manually convert from .pbn to .lin format for input into tenace.)

score: 0.2
---------------------------------------------------------------

Alternative software

To complete these MON OKRs you can use any of the following
bridge programs:  wBridge5, Jack, Bridge Baron or Qplus.
Only wBridge5 lets you enter your own deals for free.  The
others provide only some pre-selected deals unless you
buy a license.  The executables for wBridge5 and Jack
are included.  To use Bridge Baron or Qplus, you need
to download a free executable from the web link given
when you run ./bridgeBaron.sh or ./qplus.sh

It is recommended to try all four bridge programs -
each has its unique strengths.
