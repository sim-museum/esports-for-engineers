TROUBLESHOOTING FAQ

Q: Why do several scripts print out sudo commands but not execute them?

A: sudo commands change your overall system configuration.  By
instructing you to copy/paste sudo commands manually one by one, 
rather than executing them automatically, the script lets you 
decide whether to execute each command.

Q: My USB joystick is plugged in, but the sim doesn't recognize
it.  What to do?

A: Unplug the joystick, then plug it back in.  If that doesn't 
work exit the sim and restart.

Q: When I try to install THU/battleOfBritain.sh and SAT/BMS4.35/BMS4.35.sh 
I get an error message that my version of wine is too old.  How
to fix this?

A: Run ./wine_experimental.sh

Q: After I run ./wine_experimental.sh, every time I install
I get a dialog box asking whether I want to install wine-mono.
How should I respond?

A: Never install wine-mono.

Q: During install I get an Ubuntu dialog box giving me options
of wait or force quit.  What to do?

A: Wait 30 seconds.  If the dialog box does not disappear by
itself, type <ALT> TAB to see if there is a sim dialog 
displaying on another window.  You may need to change window
focus and hit the ENTER key to select a button on that sim
dialog box.

Q: When I run ./wine_experimental.sh and then install
./battleOfBritain.sh, I get a dialog asking whether to
install wine-gecko.  Should I?

A: Yes.  Online help in ./battleOfBrittain.sh requires 
wine-gecko.

Q: While I was adjusting resolution parameters the display
and keyboard locked up.  What to do?

A: Assuming you're using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as recommended -
type <CTRL><ALT>F3.  This switches to the text-only console.
Log in, then type

ps -a | grep exe$

you should see some windows .exe files running, each with a 
4 digit process id (PID).  Kill these processes via the
command

sudo kill -9 <PID2> <PID2> <PID3> ...

now type <CTRL><ALT>F1 to get to the graphics login screen.
Log in, and return to your desktop session.

Q: Installing a sim takes a long time.  Is there a way to
speed it up?

A: No, but multitasking is easy when you only have to 
click on an install dialog box every once in a while
to keep the install process going.

Q: When I load an iso with sudo mount, a disk icon 
appears on the left in the file view, and stays there
until I eventually turn my computer off.  What to do?

A: After the installation is done, unmount the iso
by clicking on the chevron to the right of the disk icon.

Q: What else can I do if I still get graphics glitches?

A: Try reducing graphics settings.  Switching to the newer version 
of wine via:
./wine_experimental.sh
might help.

Q: Can I use a game pad to control the sims?  

A: Yes.  The most difficult sim to control is TUE/gpl.sh.  
The video at the link below shows a player achieving negative
GPL Rank at Watkin's Glen using a gamepad and also using
the default setup, including a full tank of gas(!)  Search for
Gamepad in the GPL replay folder to see a replay.

Note:
try gamepad
just because this is possible doesn't mean it's easy.

Q: Why are fantasy sims not included?  

A: Fantasy sims are just too different from realistic simulation games to fit in with
the esports-for-engineers collection.  Some of the most creative and/or influencial free
fantasy sims are:
adventure

Q: Why are dual screens recommended for the THU games (Mig Alley, Battle of Britain)?

A: If not running a campaign, just turn on virtual desktop via ./setWineDisplayResolution.sh
to run the THU games with a single monitor.  

With Mig Alley, it is possible to run campaign on 
a single monitor, so long as you untic all ./setWineDisplayResolution.sh graphics boxes
and, whenever you switch from 3D to 2D campaign view, take the following steps:
1. click on "Size" at upper right in the 2D campaign view
2. click and drag the canvas border to "wake up" icons
3. select remove icons at upper right
4. select restore icons
5. now you can click on one 2D icon before you need to repeat steps 2-4.

So far, now method has been found to restore single monitor 2D icons during battle of Britain campaign.
For 3D view, untic all ./setWineDisplayResolution.sh graphics boxes, for 2D view,
select decorate in the graphics window.  But how to switch graphics settings while the game is
running?  The source code for these games is available - see the esports for engineers
github issues tab.

Q: What graphics settings are needed for rFactor 1 on linux?

A: leave the resolution field blank, choose high quality DX9, select run in window,
be sure to run
winetricks dxvk

Q: How can I participate in free online GPL races?

A: You can race GPL online at any time using iGor.  For more information, see
this link:

Q: Will these sims work on a 5 year old laptop with Intel internal graphics (no
graphics card)?

A: Yes.  If you don't have a graphics card, use the CPU versions of the WED and
FRI machine learning engines.  Use WED/INSTALL/lc0_cpu and FRI/INSTALL/katagoCpuOnly. 
All the 3D sims should run fine on a 5 old laptop without a dedicated graphics card.

Q: How do I install the latest linux version of the FRI weiqi software katrain?

A: pip install katrain
To run it, simply type
katrain
From the pulldown menu at upper left, select General and Engine settings to
download networks and versions of the katago engine.

Q: GPL crashes occasionally in online races.

A: This can happen if the polygons that make up a track are not
perfectly continuous.  To prevent this problem, select
77K Track Gap Freeze Fix v.09 in the GEM options window on 
the lower right of the GEM+ screen.

Q: Why is a dual monitor setup recommended for the THU games?

A: When running campaign in either Mig Alley or Battle of Britain,
the player alternates between the 2D strategy screen and the 3D
flight simulator view.  The trick to smooth gameplay is to 
find graphics settings that work for both the 2D and the 3D view.
One setting that works is all tick boxes off in ./setWineDisplayResolution.sh
Graphics tab turned off except the control windows tick box, then
run 
./delayedMonitorReset.sh 0
to set both monitors to max resolution, then start the game.  If
an occluding black box appears in 3D view, try changing the primary
display in the Ubuntu Settings/Displays screen.  Keep trying different
settings until the 3D black box disappears, or use the workarounds 
described in the THU documentation.  Yes, these classic games are worth 
the trouble.

Q: My old laptop doesn't have a dedicated graphics card.  Will all the games
still work?  

A: The FRI game engine katago is configured to run on a graphics card GPU,
so you'll need to use the FRI/INSTALL/katago/katagoCpuOnly binary rather
than the FRI/INSTALL/katago/katago binary.  Generate a new gtp.cfg file
using katagoCpuOnly via 
katagoCpuOnly genconfig -model default_model.bin.gz -config gtp_no_gpu.cfg

An alternative is to simply use the older gnugo engine rather than katago,
but gnugo does not provide the heatmap analysis and strong play katago
provides.

Generally, the games in the tar file work well with old graphics hardware.
The only game that may not work is the most advanced version of the BMS
add-on for the SAT game.  The included SAT game, freeFalcon.sh, should
work fine.

Q: I want to use a different linux distro rather than Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.  Will the
games still work?

A: These games were all installed and configured for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
For best results, create a 350 GB or larger 22.04 LTS partition just for these games, it
only takes 30 minutes or so, improves security, and will save you the time
you'd otherwise spend fiddling with settings.

That said, most games will work on other Ubuntu versions, but expect to do some
troubleshooting.  You may not be able
to avoid the THU black box issue (see above) if not using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
One issue is that the FRI katago binary may crash, e.g. because it's missing
a library.  If libzip.so.5 is missing, for example,
A work around is to symlink the existing libzip.so.4
to the needed library via, e.g.,

sudo apt install -y libzip-dev
sudo apt install -y libzip4
# install mlocate and use it to find the .so library file
sudo apt install mlocate
sudo updatedb
locate libzip
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libzip.so.4 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libzip.so.5


Q:  Which version of wine should I use for each game?

A:  The only games that don't work with wine_default are
battleOfBritain.sh in THU and the optional SAT game 
./BMS435.sh, this later game requiring an optional download.
The stable wine_default.sh is recommended for all the other
games.  Caveat: You might want to use ./wine_experimental.sh
for MON/wBridge5.sh, which allows you to use online help and 
save games without setting the ./setWineDsplayResolution.sh
to Windows XP.

Q:  wine_experimental.sh uses a saved version of wine 7.7 (Staging).  Would
the latest version of winehq-staging work better?

A: It's impossible to say for sure, as the wine version winehq-staging
points to changes every couple of weeks.  So far, up to wine 6.11 (Staging)
there seems to be no benefit to using a wine version more recent
than ./wine_experimental.sh

A possible exception is the SUN game, which may have fewer graphics
artifacts with a more recent version of winehq-staging, but that's
not entirely clear.

Q: My laptop has 1366x768 resolution.  Can I still play the games?

A: Yes, although you won't be able to use the dual monitor workaround
for the THU games.  If you find that part of the game screen is
getting cut off, set resolution to 800x600, which works well for 
these old games.

Q: FRI/KaTrain.sh runs on a graphics card, but my laptop doesn't have one.
Is there some way I can still use KaTrain?

A: Yes!  Upgrade to the newest native linux version of katrain via:
pip3 install katrain

The katrain executable will not be in your path by default.  Add it via, e.g.,
export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH

Once in katrain, left click on the bars icon at upper left and select
General & Engine Settings.  Choose FRI/INSTALL/katago/katagoCpuOnly
as your engine, or download one of the engines recommended by katrain.  
Similarly for the model file.
