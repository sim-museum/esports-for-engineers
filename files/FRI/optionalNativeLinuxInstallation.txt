Check that the correction version of wine is installed via the command

wine --version

if the result is not "wine-6.0" issue the command

sudo apt install -y wine-development

If wine is installed, no further installation is needed to run:
goreviewparter.sh  (play against Leela Zero)

If using Ubuntu 22.04LTS, KaTrain.sh (play against KataGo) will also work.
The above programs are MS Windows binaries that run under wine.

sabaki and g5go are provided as linux binaries  which require the linux binary version
of KataGo.  

To configure linux KataGo:
cd INSTALL/katago/CPU-slow
./katago_CPU_EIGEN_2204LTS genconfig
# it is recommended to specify an additional limit to make KataGo move much faster: 10 seconds
# otherwise defaults
# note 6block.bin.gz is copied to default_model.bin.gz, which is used here
# a different weight file could be used in the genconfig
# command with the optional -model flag, see documentation

Now returning to the FRI directory and configuring sakaki:
Run ./sabaki.sh
Choose Engine/Show Engine Sidebar
Then on the left click on the down arrow and select Manage Engines
click Add
specifiy the name katago
click on the folder icon and navigate to the katago binary in FRI/INSTALL/katago
for arguments specify
gtp -config gtp.cfg
# katago command is <path>/katago_CPU_EIGEN_2204LTS gtp -config 'gtp.cfg'

Optional: also add the gnugo engine
In the manage engines dialog (see above)
click Add
specify the name gnugo
for path specify /usr/games/gnugo
for arguments specify
--mode gtp

The KataGo configuration directory is:
$HOME/.katago
The Sabaki configuration directory is:
$HOME/.config/Sabaki

To reset configuration, delete these directories

In sabaki and other Go programs, it is recommended that beginners start with
the small 9x9 board size.

To use the latest version of KaTrain, issue these Ubuntu 20.04 linux commands:

sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install -U katrain

This will automatically calibrate KataGo for your computer hardware
Note: you'll need to add katrain to the path.  The scripts cygdb, cython and cythonize are installed 
in '$HOME/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.
sudo cp $HOME/.local/bin/katrain /usr/games
export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
