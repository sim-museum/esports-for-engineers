FRI Scoring 
eSports for Engineers 24041LTS 

In order to enter your score you'll need to save your .sfg file. If playing
against KaTrain, saved game files are in
FRI/WP/drive_c/KaTrain/sgfout.  Screenshot .png files showing
./goreviewpartner.sh ./sabaki.sh or ./q5go.sh analysis are also
useful, along with .rsfg.csv files produced by ./goreviewpartners.sh.
Copy the relevant files to the FRI/afterGameReport directory before
entering your score in launcher.py.

If your computer does not have a GPU, as is common with
laptops, be sure to use a cpu-only version of the weiqi
engine, e.g. katagoCpuOnly.

OBJECTIVE #1: LEARN FROM WEIQI BOOKS AND TUTORIAL
OBJECTIVE #2: LEARN FROM AI FEEDBACK
OBJECTIVE #3: (ASPIRATIONAL) DEMONSTRATE WEIQI PROFICIENCY
OBJECTIVE #4: USER DEFINED (can be regular or aspirational)

---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #1,1

Add .05 to your daily score for each of the following tasks you complete:

viewing the q5go “Learn Go” tutorial and using the “Open
in Editor…” function to play from the more difficult tutorial
positions against a q5go engine.

reading Janice Kim’s “Learn to Play Go, A Master’s Guide
to the Ultimate Game”, (Good Move Press, 2004) and working through the
examples with KataGo

reading Cho Chikun’s “Go, A Complete Introduction to the
Game”, (Kiseido Publishing, 1997) and working through the examples
with KaTrain

analyzing your games with ./goreviewpartner.sh and
printing out a pdf of each analyzed game. By keeping a
record this way, you can keep track of your improvement.  Include
./goreviewpartner.sh .rsfg files in FRI/afterGameReport.

---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #2,1

Run ./KaTrain.sh.  If you are a beginner, use a small board size such
as 9x9 and a weakened version of KataGo, such as Blinded Policy.
Choose Teaching Game.  Remember to save your game and copy the .sfg
file from FRI/WP/drive_c/KaTrain/sgfout to FRI/afterGameReport.

Let u be the number of times KaTrain teaching game undid your move and
s be the number of points on the side of the Go board (s=7 for a 7x7
board).

score = {1 – u/(s*2)}*.25, with score capped at 0.25, if score <0 then
score =0

---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #2,2

In Sabaki, turn on Engine/analysis before your first move.  Let the
highest value that appears at any point on the board be m.  If using a
9x9 board, no handicap stones and 0 komi, that value is roughly 96%.
If using a 19x19 board with no handicap stones and 6.5 komi, the
maximum is about 51%.  Your score is zero unless you win, so use as
small a board, and as many handicap stones as you need to win.  Engine
analysis (heat map) must be turned off during the game.  After you’ve
won a game, use that initial highest value to determine your score per
this formula.

score = (1-(m-50)/50)*.4, if score>.4 then score=.4, if score<0 then
score=0

If you are using the default 6block network, multiply your score by
0.8 (There is no penalty if using the larger 15block.bin.gz network
with KataGo)

---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #3,1

score = (1-(m-50)/50)*.7, if score > .7, score =.7.  if score<0 
then score=0.  Same as OKR #2, 2, but use
the 19x19 board with 6.5 komi and give KataGo a time limit of not less
than 1 minute per move.  Also let KataGo calculate during your
turn.  Use as many handicap stones as needed to win.
