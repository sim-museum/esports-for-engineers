TUE Scoring 
eSports for Engineers 24041LTS 

Note: save your replay file after each race.  For Grand Prix Legends, these files are stored in
TUE/WP/drive_c/Sierra/GPL/replay.  Copy your .rpy files, along with
setup files, screenshot .png files showing your games and analysis, to
the TUE/afterGameReport directory, calculate your score as described
below, and then enter your score using launcher.py

Note: these OKRs can be completed with either Grand Prix Legends or rFactor 1.

If you use the open source sim racing software Speed Dreams, you'll have to write your own
OKR's the tracks are unlike real world tracks (one exception is Forza, which
is like Monza).  If using the rFactor 1 (rF1) 2019 Formula E cars, write new OKRs
to account for the difference in speed of these electric cars.

Grand Prix Legends is included, is well-supported by community volunteers, and free.
rF1 has newer physics and AI, but and you would have to purchase it and
run it on MS windows.  Which is better?  Which would you rather buy, a well-maintained 
vintage car with a lot of character, or a bland newer car with better tech?  While
rF1 has better force feedback, GPL has better artwork, though the rF1 Spa track is
outstanding.

OBJECTIVE #1: LEARN SIMRACING WELL ENOUGH TO RACE ONLINE
OBJECTIVE #2: (ASPIRATIONAL) ACHIEVE COMPETITIVE QUALIFYING TIMES ON SET OF TRACKS
OBJECTIVE #3: USER DEFINED (can be regular or aspirational)
---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #1, 1, first key result for objective "learn simracing well enough to race online"

Run ./replay.sh. Choose File/Add replay lap. In the list look for
replays with the prefix “LOR_”.  These are benchmark replays made by
an expert Grand Prix Legends driver with initials LOR.  Choose
an LOR replay for the Watkins Glenn track and review it.

Now run ./gpl-demo.sh and make sure the 1967 carset is chosen.  Select
the Watkins Glenn track.  You’ll also want to load a LOR setup file for 
that track (chose "car setup" at bottom left within GPL).  Read the fs or LOR track guide for
Watkins Glen, which you will find at:
../TUE/DOC/trackGuidesAndSetups_LOR/GPL_trackguide_WatkinsGlen_by_LOR.pdf

"GPL rank" for a track is your lap time minus the benchmark lap time for that track.
(For a set of tracks, the GPL rank is the sum of the GPL ranks for each track in the set).
In other words, the GPL rank for a set of tracks is your time minus the benchmark time,
where these times are for a long track composed of all the tracks in the set attached
together.

The GPL rank ratio is: 
For one track:
(your laptime - benchmark laptime)/(benchmark laptime)
or for a set of tracks
(sum of your laptimes - sum of benchmark lap times)/(sum of benchmark laptimes)

Calculate your GPL rank ratio for Watkin's Glen.  Look up the benchmark time
in the tables at the end of this file.  For Watkin's Glen, this benchmark
time is 1:06.912 (1 minute, 6.912 seconds).

score={1-3*GPL rank ratio)*.1, if score>.35 then score=.35, if score<0 then score=0
---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #1, 2
Same as OKR #1, 1, except with the Spa 67 track. (Note: if you installed
using the GPL iso, you have all of the GPL RANK tracks listed at the
end of this file installed.  Choose any of these, not limiting yourself
to Watkins Glen and Spa, and use the appropriate fs guide, setup and replay.
The LOR guide is for the older Spa track, not Spa 67, so use the fs guide for Spa 67).

Note: Your daily total is the sum of your OKR scores (subject to an 
upper limit of 0.7 unless you have an aspirational OKR score above 0.7).

---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #1, 3
After completing OKR #1, 1 or OKR #1, 2, use GPL Motec or pribluda
to tailor your tire temperature profile, improve your grip and
reduce your lap time.  

Pribluda provides the race telemetry text that appears on the 
GPL 3D view by default.  

To use GPL Motec as well, which is recommended, follow these steps:
1. use a dual monitor setup.  You need this because the GPL
Modtec real-time dashboard appears on your second monitor.
2. (If using rF1, run addTelemetryLoggerToRfactor.sh to install telemetry.)
Before starting GPL, run twoMonitorTelemetry.sh to start GPL Motec
3. start GPL, enter the 3D view and wait for the GPL Motec 
display to appear 3 minutes after you started GPL Motec.
4. Use <ALT> TAB and <ALT> F6 in Ubuntu to return keyboard
focus to the GPL window.  (A lot of trouble, but worth it!) 

(Note that GPL Motec only works with the
66 mod, the 67 mod, and those 67x cars which are also in the 67 mod)

Where DT is your lap time reduction in seconds due to tailoring tire 
temperature profile,

score={(DT/5)*.2, if score>.2 then score=.2, if score<0 then score=0

---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #1, 4
On a track of your choice, run a complete practice session along
with the AI cars.  If using Grand Prix Legends, save the
practice session and exit.  Use ./editRaceLineup.sh to load
the saved practice session file and reduce
AI speed (note that this utility works only with the 65 and 67 mod,
and with those 67x cars which are also in the 67 mod).  Set the race
to be at least 3 laps in length, and with full damage.
Run the race and win it (no points if you don't win).

score= .05 if racing against F3 cars, .1 if racing against F2
cars, and .2 if racing against F1 cars.  

(if using rFactor 1, use the JR AI improvement plugin, adjust AI
speed with the AI speed slider, and give yourself 
a score consistent with the Grand Prix Legends scoring.)

OKR #1, 5
The following tasks are worth .05 points each:

Read Ian Korf’s book, “You Suck at Racing: A Crash
Course for the Novice Driver”, or similar

skim all documentation in the TUE directory

read the documentation in the setupGuides directory,
develop a new setup, and test it on two tracks 

finish a 67SC sports car race with Pit Stop and
Keypress selected in GEM with 15 cars or more participating, where you
beat at least 5 cars with AI speed set to 2 in GEM.

Choose one of the new high-quality tracks (Montjuic Park v2, Thruxton, 
Goodwood 65, Spa 67, Isle of Man, Beal Valley, Wilmot).  Set
up a 3 lap race vs. Formula 2 or Formula 3 AI opponents, using
./editRaceLineup.sh as described in DOC/exampleScoreDescription.txt

Tune setups using the skidfun track.  Note that you can drive
either direction on this track, or drive in figure 8's, or
drive in any other way so long as you stay between the outer
circle of cones and the inner circle of cones.

Practice trail braking on the Zandvoort and Wilmot tracks. Examine
how expert GPL drivers use trail braking by reviewing the 
replay files
Wilmot Fer_65 38_31_T.rpy
Wilmot Lot_65 38_60_T.rpy
LOR_Zand12573.rpy
in GPL replay analyzer.
If you don't have enough oversteer to trail brake, stiffen the
rear roll bar by 20% while loosening the front by 20%.

finish 10 iGor races.  In GEM simply click on “iGor” to
see available races.  If there are none available, start one of your
own, selecting a car and track you haven’t used before, or haven’t
used often.

finish in the top 25% of an online "iGor" race with at least 10
drivers participating.  To join such a race, select iGor from the GEM
screen.  (Although some races are open to anyone, you may need to join 
a GPL league to participate in the race).

---------------------------------------------------------------
OKR #2, 1
In Grand Prix Legends run qualifying laps on all Challange Rank
tracks or Historical Rank tracks with the '67 mod or '67x mod,
or all GPL55 tracks using the 55 mod.  (Benchmark times for
all these tracks are listed at the end of this file).  
If you get a negative GPL rank overall, give yourself a score of 
1 good for the next month - you earned it!

(If using rFactor 1, the track set is all 
the tracks added on by rFactor.sh.  Use the JR AI improvement plug 
in.  Run races with the 67 cars on Watkin's Glen, Monaco, Brands Hatch,
Bremergarten, Spa, Goodwood and Zandervoot. Use the 67 benchmark times
for these tracks listed below.  In addition, run races with the 58
cars on Monaco, Zandervoot and Spa.  For these races, use the
55 benchmark times below.  Compute your GPL rank and
ratio using all 10 of these races, including both the 67 and
the 58 races.)

If your GPL rank is positive, your score is 
score=0.7/(GPL ratio), with maximum score of .7

GPL rank benchmark times are as follows (vis. https://gplrank.schuerkamp.de/php-pub/user.php?showRanks)
